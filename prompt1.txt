i just want the JSON export system. Exactly what i want is that i want a python program that traverses the FeatureManager Design Tree of part, assembly or drawing files (any one at a time) and returns a JSON with all the features' parameters, definitions and other metrics such that when this JSON is given to an LLM it generates a python script to recreate that part in the same manner it was created originally and to have the same feature manager tree in Solidworks. Crux: LLM Generates python scripts for automating the creation process of solidworks part, assembly or drawing from a JSON as input which tells the FeatureManager Design tree of that part, assembly or drawing and JSON also tells all the necessary parameters, definitions and other metrics required by the LLM. I want a python script that creates this JSON from an already existing solidworks part, assembly or drawing by traversing the FeatureManager Design Tree
